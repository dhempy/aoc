##Advent Of Code 2021

My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2021 .

I'm taking the Advent of Code challenge as a time to learn Python. Let's see if my Phython improves
from day to day. 

PLEASE let me know any ways I can make cleaner programs. In particular, I feel like I'm not doing things
The Python Way, and wasting a lot of time building my own iterators and such, ignoring some 
of the more graceful, powerful constructs of Python. Feedback is encouraged, and the more direct the better. 

I intend to push my daily solutions only after the next day's problem is posted. 
Feel free to use anything here for anything you want.
