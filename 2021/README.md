##Advent Of Code 2021

My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2021 .

I'm taking the Advent of Code challenge as a time to learn Python. Let's see if my Phython improves
from day to day. 

PLEASE let me know any ways I can make cleaner programs. In particular, I feel like I'm not doing things
The Python Way, and wasting a lot of time building my own iterators and such, ignoring some 
of the more graceful, powerful constructs of Python. Feedback is encouraged, and the more direct the better. 

Keep in mind this is contest code, not production code. What you see here is not polished, COMPELTELY ignores edge cases, and frequently accepts abhorent abuses in the sake of fast completion of a single, specific input. 

I intend to push my daily solutions only after the next day's problem is posted. 
Feel free to use anything here for anything you want.
